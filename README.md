# UBC Grades Boost

This full-stack project was designed to help UBC students with their course planning. With a robust query engine that parses historical UBC course data, users can determine which courses have course averages above their input threshold. Further, for any particular course, users can get details on averages spliced by professor, ranked in descending order. 

Built using TypeScript and Tailwind/daisyUI.

While this public repository holds only the front-end UI, I would be pleased to provide a full project walkthrough upon request.

**User Stories:**
1. As a UBC student, I want to determine which courses have historical averages above a given threshold, so that I can make informed course planning decisions and maximize my GPA for the upcoming term.
2. As a UBC student, I want to view instructors' historical averages for a given course, so that I can make informed course planning decisions and maximize my GPA for the upcoming term.
